# Introduction

Statement of the problem, partitioning cluster analysis for high-dimensional
data, fuzzy algorithms, general package for whole cluster analysis process,
own distance function

# Summary
The package \code{fuzzyclara}

# Statement of Need
The concepts of fuzzy . Together with this, we aim to provide a package
reflecting the pipeline for performing 
\\ R offers several packages containing. However, a combination of both
methods

# Combination of fuzzy and CLARA/CLARANS clustering
- Algorithmus/Flowchart
- Fuzzy for Subsamples
- Formel f√ºr Verrechnung

# Clustering pipeline

# Application
